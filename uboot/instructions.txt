Installing on a new Beaglebone Black
====================================

The latest versions of the Beaglebone Black come with a version of
Debian. Moreover, the version of uBoot that is used with Debian seems to be
incompatible with Starterware (on which this software is based). The easiest
solution to this is to simply downgrade the software on the Beaglebone Black to
the Angstrom Distribution available from <http://beagleboard.org/latest-images>
or more directly from
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/angstrom/demo/beaglebone/BBB-eMMC-flasher-2013.09.04.img.xz>.

Put this image on a suitable micro-SD card (see the Beagleboard getting started
web pages) and place it in the Beaglebone Black. Hold down the button "S3 Power"
as you power up the device (hold for 10 sec or so) so that the Beaglebone boots
from the SD card rather than internal memory. Leave the Beaglebone for 30
minutes to an hour for the Angstrom Distribution to be installed.

Once Angstrom has been installed, reboot the Beaglebone and then edit the
uEnv.txt on it to contain the line

uenvcmd=mmcinfo;fatload mmc 0 0x80000000 app.bin; go 0x80000000

***NOTE*** On some recent versions of the Beaglebone Black the Angstrom flasher
doesn't appear to work. Instead, connect the Beaglebone Black to a computer via
USB and, once it has started up, SSH to the Beaglebone (192.168.7.2 is the
default IP address) and log in with username debian, password temppwd. Run the
command `sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1024 count=1024` to erase the
bootloader from the device. Now the Beaglebone Black will boot directly from the
micro-SD card.

The Beaglebone Black seems to be sensitive to the format of the micro-SD card
and the easiest way to get it right is to download the Angstrom image
<https://s3.amazonaws.com/angstrom/demo/beaglebone/Angstrom-Cloud9-IDE-GNOME-eglibc-ipk-v2012.12-beaglebone-2013.06.20.img.xz>
onto the micro-SD card and edit the uEnv.txt file on the SD card to contain the
line above.

Reboot again and the Beaglebone will try to load the file called app.bin from
the SD card - this is the code you generate here.


Connecting to the Beaglebone Black via serial cable
===================================================

The Kermit (C-Kermit) program can be used to connect to the Beaglebone Black
using the UART-USB connection (buy a suitable FTDI cable). The settings needed
are

set line /dev/ttyUSB0
set speed 115200
set carrier-watch off
set handshake none
set flow-control none
set prompt "Kermit> "

These can be put in manually or into ~/.kermrc

The advantage of the Kermit program (over, say, screen) is that it can be used
to send files to the board with the send command. Also, it makes use of the
terminal paging (i.e., it doesn't just keep 24 lines of output!).

There are other terminals that can be used with the same settings.
