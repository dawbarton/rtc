# wordswap swaps labels if the pin is on the right side an looks like this:									
"#   ""PB1 (CLK)"". That's useful for micro controller port labels"									
# rotate_labels rotates the pintext of top and bottom pins									
#   this is useful for large symbols like FPGAs with more than 100 pins									
# sort_labels will sort the pins by it's labels									
#   useful for address ports	 busses	 ...

# tabseparated list of pin descriptions

# pinnr is the physical number of the pin									
# seq is the pinseq= attribute	 leave it blank if it doesn't matter								
# type can be (in	 out	 io	 oc	 oe	 pas	 tp	 tri	 clk	 pwr)
# style can be (line	dot	clk	dotclk	none). none if only want to add a net					
# posit. can be (l	r	t	b) or empty for nets						
# net specifies the name of the net. Vcc or GND for example.									
# label represents the pinlabel.									
#	"negation lines can be added with ""\_"" example: \_enable\_ "								
#	"if you want to write a ""\"" use ""\\"" as escape sequence"
