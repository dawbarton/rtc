Overview
--------

This document describes how to build firmware for the real-time controller,
install suitable device drivers for the real-time controller and use it with
Matlab.

It is not necessary to build the firmware if you have already have suitable
firmware to use.


To build the real-time controller firmware (optional)
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Download GCC ARM compiler from
   <https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2014-q4-major/>.

    * Any recent version (i.e., post 2013) should work. Probably even ones
      earlier than that will work as well.

2. Install ARM compiler and add it to your path.

3. Install Git and Make via your system package manager.

    * Fedora: `sudo yum install git make`.

    * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install git build-essential`.

4. Clone the necessary repositories from [GitHub](http://github.com/db9052/).

        git clone https://github.com/db9052/rtc rtc
        cd rtc
        git clone https://github.com/db9052/starterware starterware

5. Build TI Starterware.

        cd build
        make starterware
        cd ..

6. Build the rig of your choice, e.g., duffing_numerical for a simple test

        cd rigs/duffing_numerical
        make

7. Put the resulting `.bin` file on a micro SD card as app.bin. There should
   also be a file called `uEnv.txt` on the SD card which contains the following
   text (only).

        uenvcmd=mmcinfo;fatload mmc 0 0x80000000 app.bin; go 0x80000000

Once you have done all this once, you only need to repeat steps 6 and 7 to
compile new versions of your firmware.


Device drivers for the USB interface to the real-time controller
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy `rtc/udev/90-rtc.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-rtc.rules`.

    * You may need to run `udevadm control --reload-rules` to force udev to
      reload its rules.

2. Install libusb via your system package manager.

    * Fedora: `sudo yum install libusb`.

    * Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install libusb`.

2. The real-time controller is now ready for use with Matlab.


To use the real-time controller in Matlab
-----------------------------------------

1. Make sure that you have a suitable compiler for using the Matlab mex
   function. (Check the output of `mex -setup`.)

    * A suitable (free) compiler is gcc which is installable via your system
      package manager.

2. Start Matlab.

3. Add `controlcont\rtc\matlab` to the Matlab path (`help addpath`).

4. Add the appropriate rig directory to the Matlab path, e.g.,
   `controlcont\rtc\rigs\duffing_numerical`.

5. Create the interface to the controller with

        rtc = duffing_numerical_interface()

6. All the controller parameters are available through
   `rtc.par.<variable name>`.

7. Time series data can be collected through the use of streams; see the help
   for `rtc.set_stream`, `rtc.run_stream`.

    * By default, 5 different streams (0-4) are available for use.

    * The maximum amount of data a stream can return is around 8 MB.

Note: this assumes that a rig specific interface is used to set default
parameters. This is not necessary and the generic rtc_interface can be used
instead if desired.


To use the real-time controller in Python (2.x or 3.x)
------------------------------------------------------

1. Ensure that python-libusb1 and numpy are installed for your Python
   distribution.

    * Numpy is available via most Linux package managers

    * python-libusb1 is available via some Linux package managers or using pip

            pip install python-libusb1

    * The python-libusb1 files usb1.py and libusb1.py are included for
      convenience and, as such, a separate installation of python-libusb1 is not
      needed.

2. Start Python.

3. Import the Python module and create the interface to the controller with

        import rtc_interface
		rtc = rtc_interface.rtc_interface()

4. All the controller parameters are available through
   `rtc.par.<variable name>`.

5. Time series data can be collected through the use of streams; see the help
   for `rtc.set_stream`, `rtc.run_stream`.

    * By default, 5 different streams (0-4) are available for use.

    * The maximum amount of data a stream can return is around 8 MB.

Note: if desired, rig specific interfaces for Python can be created in much the
same way as for Matlab.
